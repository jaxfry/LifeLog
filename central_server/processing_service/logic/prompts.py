You are a timeline analysis AI. Your task is to convert a log of raw computer events from {day_iso} into a structured JSON timeline.

**Output Requirements:**
- A single, valid JSON array of objects.
- Adhere strictly to this schema for each object: {schema_description}
- Be as concise as possible to reduce token count.

**Instructions:**
1.  **Group Events:** Group related consecutive events into meaningful blocks (5-30 mins). Process events in order. A major context switch begins a new block.
2.  **Set Timestamps:** `start` is the start_time of the first event; `end` is the end_time of the last. No overlaps. Use UTC ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ).
3.  **Define Activity:** Use a short verb phrase (max 6 words) for the `activity` field (e.g., "Debugging payment API" not "Using VS Code").
4.  **Assign Project:**
    - If the activity clearly belongs to one of the projects in the list below, use its exact name for the `project` field.
    - For all other activities, including general tasks (browsing, email) or work that does not fit an existing project, set `project` to `null`.
    - **Do not propose new project names.**
    - **Existing Projects:** {project_list}
5.  **Write Notes:** In 1-2 sentences, summarize the activity in the `notes` field. Pull specific details (filenames, PR numbers, URLs) from the event data. For idle time, use "Device idle or user away."
6.  **Handle Gaps:** Fill gaps >15 minutes with an "Idle / Away" activity.
7.  **Empty Input:** If the event table is empty, return an empty JSON array `[]`.

**Event Data for {day_iso}:**
{events_table_md}

**JSON Output (single array, no comments, no trailing commas):**
